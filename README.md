# DS_Bootcamp_2023
Homework from the Data Science course that aims to provide a thorough knowledge of DS/ML, specifically in the areas of Sensor Fusion and Computer Vision.

This repository contains three major projects implemented during the course:
1) [**Physical Activity Recognition**](https://github.com/Mykhailo20/DS_Bootcamp_2023/tree/main/Homework_5/Physical_Activity_Analysis): An NN model trained on a self-collected dataset to recognize physical activity types based on accelerometer and gyroscope data.
2) [**ANPR with YOLOv8, OpenCV and EasyOCR**](https://github.com/Mykhailo20/DS_Bootcamp_2023/tree/main/Homework_10/Analysis): The algorithm developed for localization and alignment of license plates on images of cars and recognition of characters on them using OCR.
3) [**Online Garbage Classifier**](https://github.com/Mykhailo20/DS_Bootcamp_2023/tree/main/Final_GBCL): A Streamlit application that uses a trained CNN model based on ResNet152 to classify a user uploaded garbage image.
