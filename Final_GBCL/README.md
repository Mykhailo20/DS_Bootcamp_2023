## :open_file_folder: Project Files Description
This project includes 3 Python files and 3 directories as follows:

**Python files**:
1. **nn_model.py** - Contains functions for configuring TensorFlow, loading and using a neural network model.
2. **preprocess_image.py** - Contains functions for preparing original images for use in the CNN model, which is based on ResNet152.
3. **main.py** - Contains code for the Streamlit application functionality.

**Directories**:
1. **images**: 
   * **classes_images** - Contains images of classic representatives of each class of garbage.
   * **assets** - Contains the images used in the README file.

2. **modules** - Contains files nn_model.py and preprocess_image.py for working with CNN models.
3. **styles** - Contains a styles.css file with additional settings for the CSS styles of the application's main web page.
